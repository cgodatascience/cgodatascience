**👋 Hi there! My name is Carmen Gómez Valenzuela and I am a Data Scientist.**

This website serves as both my portfolio and personal notepad where I share my insights and ideas about Data Analysis, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and related fields.

In addition, I also run a blog where I share interesting discoveries from around the world.

Please note that this site, much like life, is constantly “under construction”. If you are interested in Data or Artificial Intelligence, or would like to discuss potential collaboration opportunities, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn.

Best regards!
